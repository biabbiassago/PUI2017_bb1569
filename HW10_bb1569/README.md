# PUI2017 HW 10

I have used my 72 h extension for this assignment. 

In this homework, we explore time series by using MTA Turnstile data, divided by 600 stations and 23  card types, for a period of 194 weeks between 05-2010 and 02-2014.  We construct time series that we can use to detect events, explore trends and periodicity. 

I worked on this assignment alone. However, I received some advice from Gokmen and Michael on how to load the data.
