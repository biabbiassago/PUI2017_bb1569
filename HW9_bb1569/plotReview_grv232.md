# Plot Review for grv232

This plot examines how AIDS has quickly spread in population of New York City in the early 1990s, and gives interesting insight on how it affected different groups of the New York City  population.

__CLARITY__: 

It is clear to understand what the plot is examining -- especially because the title is clear. 
However, since there is a lot of information displayed, it is a bit hard to match every line with the scale.  I would suggest to add a light grid in the background.

__AESTHETIC__: 

I think the aesthetics of the plot suffer a bit from trying to put too many lines  at the same time. Some lines are overlapping so it is hard to see their trend at a first glance. I would suggest to focus only on some information. For instance, you could remove the Total, since it reports information that is already present in the other lines. 

Moreover, since there is already a lot going on at the plot, I would remove the label "AIDS main cause of dead men" . The same information is already present in the caption, and the peak is pretty easy to identify anyways, so it seems redundant. 


# FBB However this information is not already present in the plot, and plots should be selfcontained as much as possible Since there is a large amount of empty space in the plot a label can work. However this label is aligned to a portion of the "Total" time series which I do not think is the right portion of the plot: as it is it reads that AIDS was the main cause of theadh from the beginning of that slope to its end, while likely it was the main cause of death around the pick, extending left and right from it. A good way to display it would be a horizontal bar that indicates the time range when AIDS is the leading cause of death on top of the time series, and the lable goes on top of it horizontally. There is also a typo: it should be death instead of dead


# FBB not color blind compliant

Lastly, I would place the caption below the figure, as I think it would make it stand our more and serve better the purpose of explaining the plot. 

# FBB The labels are small, at the verge of legible. 
__HONESTY__: 

The plot has clear axis labelling and legend. However, I would suggest to use percentage of population affected instead of absolute number of cases. I also find a bit confusing that men are divided in "homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual" groups while females are not. I would either only concentrate on males or report the same groups for both genders. 

# FBB this is a fair point. IN addition the placement of the label "AIDS main cause of dead men"  is also potentially "dishonest" as it may be used to indicate a range of time when AIDS is leading cause that is longer, or shorter than it really is. 

# FBB good though 9/ 10
