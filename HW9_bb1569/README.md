# PUI2017 HW 9

## Part 1: Reviewing two plots

For this part of the assignment, we worked individually. I reviewed grv232 (geeroovaa)'s plot , and mjs639's plot. 
The reviews are in this folder as well as in their repo.

## Part 2 :  GeoSpatial Analysis of LinkNYC 

_Team Composition_ : Michael M Sampson (mms911), Gokmen Dedemen (gokmen), Bianca Brusco (bb1569)

In this assignment we get Census data to see the percentage of households with broadband access, and the geographic distribution of the linkNYC around the city.
I completed most of this assignment, asked questions to the team about how to download the AFF tables, and reviewed the code with Michael. 

We used the function written by Professor Bianco (choropleth.py) for some of the plots.
